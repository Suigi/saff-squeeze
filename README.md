# Saff Squeeze Illustration

Repository trying to illustrate Kent Beck's _Saff Squeeze_ method in its commit history.

Follow the commits in the _squeeze_ branch to follow the steps I took to fix my mission-critical `Autopilot` class.

The [original description of the method](https://web.archive.org/web/20120311131729/http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/HitEmHighHitEmLow.html) can be found in the Wayback Machine.
The "mission-critical class" was inspired by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23890913).
